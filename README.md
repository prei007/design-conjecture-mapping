# An Ontology for Design Conjecture Mapping

Work on an OWL ontology for an extended version of Conjecture Mapping in Design-Base Research (DBR). 

Capturing the original CM method (Sandoval, 2014) in a formal ontology achieves two things: For one, we gain greater clarity as to the meaning of the concepts and how they should be used. Secondly, we bring CM closer to being machine-readable; this, in turn, makes it easier to store CMs in a way so that can be found on the Internet.
